[中文版 zh-CN](README.zh-CN.md)


## 🌟 Brief Project Description
MegaSnake is an exciting twist on the classic snake game, developed using JavaFX. This project enhances the traditional snake game with numerous additional fun features, including multiple themes, unique battle music, and various gameplay elements.

## 💻 Installation and Running the Project
Currently, MegaSnake is not fully packaged into a jar or exe file. To run the project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Use maven to install all dependencies.
3. Compile and run the project using an IDE that supports JavaFX, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## 🎮 How to Play
- **Start the Game**: Launch the game and choose between '🌞day' and '🌑night' themes for your comfort.
- **Choose a Theme**: Click the 'play' button to select from four different themes, each with unique difficulty levels, battle music, and snake skins.
- **View Scores**: Click the 'score' button to see the top five player scores.
- **Learn to Play**: Click the 'help' button for gameplay instructions. Use WASD or arrow keys to move your snake.

### 💎 Game Elements
- **Coin**: Earn more points.
- **Energy Gem**: Speeds up your snake and grants many points.
- **Food**: Increases your score and the length of your snake.
- **Meteor**: Lose points and potentially slow down. Be careful, as it can also reduce your snake's length!
- **Thief Snake**: Competes for food and can reduce your score and length. However, collisions are limited to reduce your length to a minimum of two segments.

### 💡 Strategy
The faster your snake moves, the more points you can earn (and lose). 
Manage your speed wisely to grow into a Mega Snake🐍!

### ⚙️ Settings
In the settings, you can toggle special items (coins, gems, meteors) and the presence of the thief snake. You can also adjust the number of food items from 1 to 5. Challenge yourself by setting the food count to 1 and dueling with the thief snake!
